    <h1>The Tea Method</h1>
    
    <p>Making a perfect cuppa every time is easy. Here's how:</p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li>Empty the contents of your kettle and re-fill it. The water must be fresh. Turn it on and let it boil.</li>
    	<li>As soon as the kettle has boiled, pour a little bit of the just-boiled water into a mug, swirl it round a bit, then pour it away. This is to warm the mug.</li>
    	<li>Now add a splash of milk and a teabag to the empty mug, lift the kettle a foot above it, and slowly pour the water over the teabag. This will help oxygenate the tea.</li>
    	<li>Take a teaspoon and slowly stir. If there are lots of bubbles, use the teabag to soak them up.</li>
    	<li>When the colour of the tea is to your liking (the darker it is, the stronger it tastes), remove the teabag.</li>
    	<li>Enjoy the best, tastiest, most deliciousful cup of tea you've ever had.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p class="small">Notes: I do milk first because that way I never over-milk a cup, and I don't get that nasty scum on the top. After 2 decades of taste testing, I've found that <a href="http://www.yorkshiretea.co.uk/">Yorkshire Tea</a> has the best flavour. And it comes in hard or soft water varieties depending on the type of water where you live. If you're feeling particularly fancy, use loose-leaf tea and a strainer instead of a teabag. Use proper milk, not UHT.</p>
